      <p>
      We are International GlobeTrotters. We are comprised of expert level adventurers who have compiled their many years of travel experience to compile our list of destination packages. Our destination list spans the entire globe. We can set you up in sunny Jacksonville, Florida, or overcast London, England, or if you prefer cold, we can even send you to the South Pole. All for prices anyone can afford with a 2nd mortgage. 
    If you’re unsure of where to go, we’ve developed a quiz to help narrow you down to a good destination. Just answer the questions and we’ll recommend an exotic locale for you to visit. Enjoy!
